Done:
 we can display a survey
 someone can take a survey

To do:
 extend cmdline tools to dump results from cmdline
 prove the results are getting persisted
 add 'thin' for performance and to suppress streaming warnings
 add users
 get panel surveys from Jason

Behaviors:
A user can see the list of panels and descriptions
A user can indicate how strongly they would like to participate in a given panel
A user can indicate whether they would like to moderate a given panel
A user can indicate whether they would attend a given panel if they aren't on it

A user's results are persisted as soon as they provide an input, not on completing a page

A user can provide a name and e-mail to start a new survey
A user can resume, review, and edit an existing survey given a secret token

A user can suggest new panels, interests, or specialties as free text

A user can indicate their availability for each broad time block
A user can indicate their reg status

A user can indicate their preference for receiving non-survey Foolscap e-mail

A survey admin can maniuplate panel names and descriptions
A survey admin can collect survey results


Steps:

- Allow them to indicate panel preferences
- Persist these
